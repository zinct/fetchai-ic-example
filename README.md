# Fetch.ai + ICP Integration:

This project demonstrates a collaborative integration between Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and Fetch.ai, showcasing how to build a Bitcoin service using ICP canisters in the backend and Fetch.ai agents which can be queried via the AISI:One LLM.

## ICP Component

The ICP component (`ic/src/backend/main.mo`) implements a dummy canister with following endpoints:

- `/get-balance` - Returns dummy balance for a Bitcoin address
- `/get-utxos` - Returns dummy UTXOs for a Bitcoin address
- `/get-current-fee-percentiles` - Returns dummy fee percentiles
- `/get-p2pkh-address` - Returns a dummy P2PKH address
- `/send` - Simulates sending Bitcoin to an address

Note: This is a dummy implementation that returns mock data. The actual implementation needs to be amended.

## IC Component

To set up and run the ICP canister locally, follow these steps:

1. **Click "Use Template" and create your own repository**

2. **Open project as a VS Code Codespace**
3. **Start up a local ICP replica:**

   ```bash
   dfx start
   ```

4. **In a separate terminal, deploy your canister:**

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

5. **In the browser, open and interact with Canister:**
   - URL: http://{canister backend id}.raw.localhost:4943/ (see id from deploy message)

---

## Fetch.ai Component

The Fetch.ai component (`agent.py`) implements an intelligent agent using the Chat Protocol, making it discoverable by ASI:One. The agent:

- Processes natural language queries about Bitcoin operations
- Converts user queries into appropriate API calls to the ICP canister
- Define the ICP endpoints as functions with descriptions and required parameters in the agent.
- Use a LLM to decide which endpoint needs to be called based on user query and the defined functions.
- Handles responses and presents them in a user-friendly format
- Supports various Bitcoin-related queries like checking balances, UTXOs, fees, and sending transactions

### Install uagents and ic-py

```bash
pip install uagents ic-py
```

### Get Your ASI:One API Key

To use the agent, you need an ASI:One API Key. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://asi1.ai/](https://asi1.ai/)
2. Log in using your Google account or Fetch Wallet.
3. Navigate to **Workbench**.
4. Select **Developer** from the menu on the left.
5. Click on **Create New** to generate a new API key.
6. Copy the generated API key.
7. Open `agent.py` and set your API key in the following line:
   ```python
   ASI1_API_KEY = "YOUR_ASI1_API_KEY"  # Replace with your ASI1 key
   ```
8. Copy the cannister ID after deploying and replace the cannister ID in the `agent.py` file.

   ```bash
   Deployed canisters.
   URLs:
   Backend canister via Candid interface:
   backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=umunu-kh777-77774-qaaca-cai&id=uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai
   ```

   ```python
   CANISTER_ID = "uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai"
   BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4943"
   ```

### Running the Agent

1. In a separate terminal, start the agent:

```bash
python3 agent.py
```

2. The agent will start and display its address and inspector URL:

```
INFO: [test-ICP-agent]: Starting agent with address: agent1qdla8t5m3wm7tnua69jjv3p4cr4ugmzmcj95jy9vrh4209scxs02qlxwt0g
INFO: [test-ICP-agent]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001&address=agent1qdla8t5m3wm7tnua69jjv3p4cr4ugmzmcj95jy9vrh4209scxs02qlxwt0g
```

3. Click on the Agent Inspector link to connect the agent with Agentverse via Mailbox

![Mailbox done](./fetch/images/mailbox-done.png)

4. Test the agent using the Chat interface with queries like:

   - Once connected, click on Agent Profile
     ![Agent Profile](./fetch/images/agent-profile.png)

   - Click on `Chat with Agent` to test the flow
     ![Chat with Agent](./fetch/images/chat-with-agent.png)

   - Type in your queries in the UI
     ![Type Query](./fetch/images/chat-ui.png)

   - Query through ASI:One
     ![Type Query](./fetch/images/asi1.png)

## Example Queries

The agent supports various types of queries:

### Balance Queries

- What's the balance of address tb1qexample1234567890?
- Can you check how many bitcoins are in tb1qabcde000001234567?

### UTXO Queries

- What UTXOs are available for address tb1qexampleutxo0001?
- List unspent outputs for tb1qunspentoutputs111

### Fee Queries

- What are the current Bitcoin fee percentiles?
- Show me the latest fee percentile distribution

### Transaction Queries

- Send 10,000 satoshis to tb1qreceiver000111
- Transfer 50000 sats to tb1qsimplewalletabc
